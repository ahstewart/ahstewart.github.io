<h1>Question</h1>
Assuming that difference imaging is a viable method for detecting transient events of a ETI-nature, can I build a pipeline in Python to make this process accurate and efficient?
<h1>Methodology</h1>
Here's what I tried. It should be known that when I started this project, I was a nascent programmer, and even more nascent SETI researcher. I really knew very little about what I was doing.
<h1>Results</h1>
<h1>Takeaways</h1>
Like anything, this project had good and bad.
<h1>Looking Forward</h1>
<h1>way for others to iterate on it</h1>
