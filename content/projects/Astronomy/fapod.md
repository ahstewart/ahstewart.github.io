# Question
NASA runs an awesome website called [Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html){:target="_blank"}, where they feature an interesting astronomical picture or video, along with a description.  
  
Using an image generation ML model, what kind of fake astronomy pictures can I create? Can I use a real APOD description to create something interesting? How would it compare to the real thing?
