Title: About Me

I've never been good at summing myself up in a sentence or two. But I would summarize my experience and interests 


Here's what my Python IDE's built-in LLM autocompletes for me when I type "Quick Bio":  
*I'm a data scientist and software engineer with a passion for astronomy and space exploration. I've worked on a variety of projects, from building image processing pipelines to detect transient events in astronomical data to developing machine learning models to predict the likelihood of exoplanet habitability. I'm currently working on a project to automate the detection of optical SETI signals using machine learning algorithms. In my free time, I enjoy stargazing, astrophotography, and reading science fiction novels.*  
  
Eh, close enough.
