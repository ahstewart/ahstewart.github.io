Summary: I have ideas, lots bad, some good. When I remember, I write them down here.

I have ideas, lots bad, some good. When I remember, I write them down here.  
  
Nearly everything I attempt nowadays is benefiting in some way from ideas someone else decided to put on the internet. Even on tiny blogs or obscure personal websites (such as this), I have found answers or inspiration.
Here, I hope to do my part in contributing to our collective pool of knowledge.  
  
I hope of you gleans an extraordinary epiphany from my bite knife idea. Or better yet, bacon sleeves.
